# mm — markdown memory & workflow system

**A file-based memory and prompt bridge that connects claude.ai (where you think) ↔ Claude Code (where you build) ↔ Obsidian (shared long-term memory).**

## What is this?

When you build with Claude, your work is split across two places: you sketch ideas and plan in **claude.ai**, then do the real work in **Claude Code** in your terminal. Those two sides don't share memory, and context evaporates between sessions, between chats, and whenever the context window compacts.

**mm** closes that gap. It's a set of [Claude Agent Skills](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) plus a small PowerShell installer that gives you:

- **One shared memory** for every project, stored as plain markdown in an Obsidian vault (passport, handoff, session history).
- **A prompt bridge** so an idea worked out in claude.ai becomes a clean, self-contained task you paste into Claude Code.
- **A simple lifecycle** — start a project, resume it, save a session, hand off to a new chat — with no copy-pasting your whole history every time.

Everything is markdown and files. No database, no cloud, no lock-in.

## How it works

mm spans three environments that share state through files, not magic:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["claude.ai<br/>(ideas, planning)<br/>mm-web-bridge skill"]
    B["Claude Code / PowerShell<br/>(real work)<br/>10 mm-* skills"]
    C["Obsidian vault<br/>(shared memory)<br/>passport · handoff · sessions"]

    A -- "self-contained prompt<br/>(copy-paste)" --> B
    B -- "writes notes" --> C
    C -- "passport + handoff<br/>loaded into Project Knowledge" --> A
    C -- "read on resume" --> B
```

- **claude.ai side** is a single skill (`mm-web-bridge`): it challenges your idea, checks fast-moving tech against the live web, and composes the prompt you'll run in Claude Code.
- **Claude Code side** is 10 `mm-*` skills that do the work and keep the vault up to date.
- **Obsidian** is just the folder where the markdown lives. Obsidian indexes it for you; mm reads and writes the files directly.

---

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI
- Windows + PowerShell (primary platform — see [Cross-platform](#cross-platform) below)
- An Obsidian vault (any folder works; Obsidian itself is optional but recommended)

### Install (Claude Code side)

```powershell
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/mworldorg/louise-skills.git
cd louise-skills

# 2. Register the skills (creates junctions into ~/.claude/skills and sets MM_REPO_ROOT)
powershell scripts/register-skills.ps1

# 3. Personalize (writes your name/paths into a gitignored local config)
/mm setup
```

### Connect the claude.ai side

1. Create a Project in claude.ai for your work.
2. Add your project's `passport.md` and `handoff.md` to **Project Knowledge**.
3. Load the `mm-web-bridge` skill (in `claude-ai-skills/mm-web-bridge/`) into that Project.
4. First message in a new chat:
   > *"Read handoff.md and passport.md, tell me where we are and suggest the next step."*

### The loop

```text
/mm resume   →   discuss in claude.ai   →   paste prompt into Claude Code   →   /mm save   →   /mm next
```

## Skills

Ten skills on the Claude Code side, plus one on the claude.ai side.

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `mm` | Dispatcher — short aliases for everything below |
| `mm setup` | One-time personalization after cloning |
| `mm-init-project` | Create a project passport + structure in the vault |
| `mm-resume` | Load passport + dashboard + last session on start |
| `mm-projects` | One-screen overview of all projects (read-only) |
| `mm-bridge` | Wrap a task into a prompt framework for Claude Code |
| `mm-handoff` | Generate the cross-chat handoff summary |
| `mm-save-session` | Capture decisions and progress into the vault |
| `mm-instructions` | Manage project instructions |
| `mm-doctor` | Health checks, version sync, consistency with passport |
| `mm-web-bridge` *(claude.ai)* | Idea partner + prompt composer in the browser |

## Integrations

mm cooperates with several external tools and bodies of work. Where it builds on someone else's project, that project keeps its own license and attribution.

- **GSD** — phase-based planning framework. mm **reads** GSD state (`.planning/` / `.gsd/`) and cooperates with it; it never writes there. *(deepest integration)*
- **Karpathy guidelines** — four meta-principles (think before coding, simplicity first, surgical changes, goal-driven) applied across both the Claude Code and claude.ai sides. MIT.
- **[context-mode](https://github.com/mksglu/context-mode)** — in-session context optimization and continuity. See [Memory layers](#two-memory-layers) for how it relates to mm. Elastic License 2.0 (source-available).
- **prompt-frameworks** — CRISPE / XML / PERSONA / HYPOTHESIS templates used by `mm-bridge`. Inspired by [awesome-claude-prompts](https://github.com/langgptai/awesome-claude-prompts), MIT.
- **[claude-code-telegram](https://github.com/RichardAtCT/claude-code-telegram)** — optional Telegram bridge, off by default. MIT.

### Two memory layers

mm and context-mode solve **different** problems and don't overlap:

- **context-mode** keeps a *single session* alive — it survives auto-compaction and `--resume` by rebuilding your working state inside Claude Code.
- **mm** keeps *long-term project history* — decisions, handoffs, and session notes that persist across sessions and across chats, in the Obsidian vault.

If you use both, context-mode already handles compaction; mm doesn't try to.

## Cross-platform

mm is **Windows-first** today: the installer (`register-skills.ps1`) and paths assume Windows + PowerShell. The skills themselves are plain markdown and platform-agnostic. Running the installer on macOS/Linux would need a shell-script equivalent — contributions welcome.

---

## Conventions

- **Personal data never lands in committed files.** Your name and paths live in a gitignored `mm-config.local.json` written by `/mm setup`. The committed config stays a generic template.
- **Single source of truth for versions** — `config.version`. Per-skill `version:` fields are intentionally granular.
- **Skills preview before they write**, and never write into GSD's `.planning/` / `.gsd/`.

---

## Documentation

- [`passport.md`](templates/passport.md) — the per-project source of truth (architecture, conventions, constraints)
- [`docs/`](docs/) — deeper guides (Telegram bridge, config loading, etc.)

---

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. New skills go in `skills/your-skill/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter; claude.ai skills go in `claude-ai-skills/` (they are **not** junctioned into Claude Code).
